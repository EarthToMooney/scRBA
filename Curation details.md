All archived versions of the model before its original release were curated, with old files being included where appropriate.<br>
Files not included from these versions were removed for any of the reasons listed below:<br>
	1. They are redundant, containing no new information or code.<br>
	2. They are obsolete versions of existing files in the same location as their current versions (such as older versions of the protein stoichiometry sheet).<br>
Some files meeting any of these criteria may have been included, due to their names and/or locations being substantially different than their most recent counterparts.
